# Strings, Ints, Floats, and Booleans

<br>
When we program in IPython notebooks, we store and manipulate data in the form of <b>variables</b>. We will primarily be using 4 types of variables: strings, ints, floats, and booleans.
<ul>
  <li><b>Strings</b> are sequences of characters and are surrounded by quotes. Characters can include not only letters, but also numbers and symbols such as punctuation and spaces. Examples of strings include "cat", "The dog is happy!", and "asdf1234!! !@#^&". For example, the word "</li>
  <li><b>Ints</b> are integers such as 1, 2, 3, 512, 87743, and -3432178.</li>
  <li><b>Floats</b> are decimals, also known as <i>floating point</i> numbers. Examples of floats include 1.5, 3.141592654, 112.0, and -32.018.</li>
  <li><b>Booleans</b> can be either True or False.
</ul>

Below is a notebook to help you learn how to manipulate these types of variables.
