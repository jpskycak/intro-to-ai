# Getting Started in Colab

<br>
It's fun to talk about AI. But what's even more fun than talking about AI, is <i>creating</i> AI. As we know from the previous unit, AI consists of running computational models on computers. Hence, in order to create AI, we first need to develop some basic coding ability.

<br>
In this course, all of our work will be done using <i>Colab</i>, Google's online platform for IPython notebooks. In these notebooks, we will be able to write and run code that is written in the Python coding language.

<br>
A walkthrough assignment is provided in the notebook below to help you get started in Colab. To enter the notebook, click the "Open in Colab" button that appears at the top.
