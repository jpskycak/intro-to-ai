# Lists, Dictionaries, and Arrays

<br>
When programming, we often work with many related pieces of data. To be organized and efficient, we store them within a single variable called a <b>data structure.</b> This way, we can efficiently perform operations on the data structure as a whole rather than having to operate on each piece of data as a separate variable.

<br>
We will primarily be using 3 types of data structures: lists, dictionaries, and arrays.
<ul>
<li><b>Lists</b> store pieces of data in a sequence, so that data can be referenced by its index in the list.</li>
  <li><b>Dictionaries</b> store pieces of data under labels called <i>keys</i>, so that data can be referenced its key in the dictionary.</li>
<li><b>Arrays</b> store pieces of data in matrices and higher-dimensional matrices called <i>tensors</i>, so that data can be referenced by its index in the matrix or tensor.</li>
</ul>

Below is a notebook assignment to help you learn how to work with these types of data structures. To enter the notebook, click the "Open in Colab" button that appears at the top.
