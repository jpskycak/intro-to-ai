# Lists, Dictionaries, and Arrays

<br>
When programming, we often work with many related pieces of data. To be organized and efficient, we store them within a single variable called a <b>data structure.</b> This way, we can efficiently perform operations on the data structure as a whole rather than having to operate on each piece of data as a separate variable.

<br>
We will primarily be using 3 types of data structures: lists, dictionaries, and arrays.
<ul>
<li><b>Lists</b> are...</li>
<li><b>Dictionaries</b> are...</li>
<li><b>Arrays</b> are...</li>
</ul>

<br>
Below is a notebook assignment to help you learn how to work with these types of data structures. To enter the notebook, click the "Open in Colab" button that appears at the top.
