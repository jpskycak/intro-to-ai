# The Third Wave꞉ Computation Power and Connectionism

<br>
Though AI suffered another round of funding cuts in the late 1980s and early 90s, increases in computation power would soon bring AI back into the public eye. The number of transistors on an integrated circuit chip, a generally accepted proxy for computation power, had been roughly doubling every two years since the early 1970s in a trend known as <b>Moore’s law</b>. From the early 70s to the early 90s, the number of transistors per chip rose from a thousand to a million, meaning that 90s computers were roughly a thousand times more powerful than those of the 70s.

The tremendous increase in computation power led to tremendous increases in the performance of AI. In 1997, <i>Deep Blue</i>, a chess-playing system 10 million times faster than those of the 1950s, succeeded in beating the world chess champion. In 2007, Carnegie Mellon researchers developed a vehicle that autonomously navigated 55 miles in an urban environment while adhering to traffic hazards and all traffic laws. In 2009, IBM’s question answering system, <i>Watson</i>, defeated the two greatest <i>Jeopardy!</i> champions by a significant margin.
