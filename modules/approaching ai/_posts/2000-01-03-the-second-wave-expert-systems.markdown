# The Second Wave꞉ Expert Systems

<br>
Though AI research suffered drastic cuts in the AI winter of the 1970s, research progress did continue, albeit at a slower rate. One particularly promising area of research was the development of <b>expert systems</b>, computer programs that emulated the decision-making ability of human experts.

<br>
To answer questions or solve problems within a specific domain, expert systems stored “if-then” rules derived from the knowledge of experts -- for example, “if the patient has a mild fever and a rash of small red bumps, then the patient has chickenpox,” or “if the patient has chickenpox, then the patient is contagious.” A user could then query the expert system with a question such as “if the patient has a rash, is the patient contagious?” and the system would locate potential paths through the if-then rules leading from “a rash” to “contagious.” Based on those paths, the system would ask follow-up questions to determine whether a path was fully valid -- in this case, “Does the rash consist of small red bumps?” If the user answered in the affirmative, the system would then explain “Yes, the patient is contagious because the patient has chickenpox.”

Unlike the AI of earlier decades, expert systems demonstrated high potential to be <i>useful.</i> A system called <i>Dendral</i> identified compounds from spectrometer readings, another system called <i>MYCIN</i> diagnosed infectious blood diseases, and finally, in 1980, an expert system called <i>XCON</i> saved a company 40 million dollars annually, thereby redeeming the reputation of AI to funders. This time, it was not just AI research that received funding -- the commercialization of AI had become a reality.

However, the profitability of expert systems was brief. The bubble burst suddenly in 1987, when Apple and IBM’s general-purpose desktop computers became more powerful than the expensive specialized software upon which many expert systems were built. Earlier successful expert systems like XCON proved too expensive to maintain, in addition to being difficult to improve, and funding again disappeared from the AI community.
